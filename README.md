# SUSTech-CS203A-2019autumn
Data structure and algorithm analysis is a really important and hard-core professional course in CS in SUSTech. This project will record all the problems which appeared in the lab of this course and the corresponding solution given by me, a stupid vegetable chicken in SUSTech. I hope that my work can help some beginners learn basic data structures and algorithms.
