# SUSTech-CS203A-2019autumn
## Preface
Data structure and algorithm analysis is a really important and hard-core professional course in CS in SUSTech. This project will record all the problems which appeared in the lab of this course and the corresponding solution given by me, a stupid vegetable chicken in SUSTech.  

My lab teacher in this course, SHEN Yun, helped me debug when I had problems solving some very hard(for me at that time) problems. She equally helped all the students and, sometimes, sacrificed her leisure time. I felt very grateful to her help.  

The professor who gave us lectures in this course, TANG Bo, also gave me much inspiration.  

My best friend Kerry is a master in this field. Many times when I had trouble solving problems, he would have his own smart way to inspire me. Much thanks to him.  

I hope that my work can, more or less, help some beginners learn basic data structures and algorithms. However, please use my codes wisely and create your own better solutions instead of just copying them. Enjoy coding!  
## Explanation
All the codes are in Java.
The naming rule of .java files: "Lab" + (int)LabNumber + (char)ProblemNumber + (String)ProblemName + (String)Specifier.
  The Specifier is a String bracketed or nothing. 
  When I provided two or more solutions for one problem, I may summarize the idea of each solution and put it into the bracket. 
  Or I may code according to the same idea but in different ways of implementation. For example, if I realized certain data structure but     it was not necessory, I would write "(Big)" as a specifier; If I did not realize certain data structure but successfully finished a         problem with the help of its core idea, I would write "(Recommended)" as a specifier; If I gave the best(fastest) solution I could         thought of, I would write "(Fastest)".
All the codes uploaded can run without being modified. However, you may check if the file name is the same as the name of the public class.
