# SUSTech-CS203A-2019autumn
Data structure and algorithm analysis is a really important and hard-core professional course in CS in SUSTech. This project will record all the problems which appeared in the lab of this course and the corresponding solution given by me, a stupid vegetable chicken in SUSTech.\n
My lab teacher in this course, SHEN Yun, helped me debug when I had problems solving some very hard(for me at that time) problems. She equally helped all the students and, sometimes, sacrificed her leisure time. I felt very grateful to her help.\n
The professor who gave us lectures in this course, TANG Bo, also gave me much inspiration.\n
My best friend Kerry is a master in this field. Many times when I had trouble solving problems, he would have his own smart way to inspire me. Much thanks to him.\n
I hope that my work can, more or less, help some beginners learn basic data structures and algorithms. However, please use my codes wisely and create your own better solutions instead of just copying them. Enjoy coding!\n
